      <p>
        HectoDNS is a DNS server that chains DNS applications designed to serve fast
        clients on low-latency, high-bandwidth connections.
      </p>

      <h3>Features</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Support of multiple listeners within a single process: <i>hectodns</i> can start several
              servers with independent resolution chain.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Process management: <i>hectodns</i> will reap and restart resolvers that die from broken apps.
              There is no need to manage multiple processes yourself. Server can be configured to spawn any
              number of resolver processes, independently from the other resolvers in a chain.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Does not care if your resolver application is thread-safe, resolvers are run within
              their own isolated address space and only serve one request at a time for maximum
              robustness.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
